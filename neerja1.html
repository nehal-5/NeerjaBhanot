       <h4> Neerja Bhanot was the senior flight purser aboard the Empress of the Seas, a Pan Am 747 that was taken over by four armed members of the Abu Nidal group at Karachi's Jinnah International Airport on its way to Frankfurt and New York.
        She assisted the three cockpit crew members in escaping during the 17-hour ordeal, which allowed the plane to be grounded and not be flown. Bhanot concealed passengers' passports, preventing the hijackers from learning the nationalities of the passengers.
         Additionally, she was able to unlock the emergency exit, helping a lot of passengers leave the aircraft. Neerja Bhanot was killed while protecting three toddlers from the gunfire of the hijackers as they started shooting at passengers and crew.

         She was the first woman and the youngest laureate of the Ashoka Prize in 1987.</h4>
